# DataWhisperer: Project Summary

## Project Overview
DataWhisperer is a voice-powered data analysis assistant designed to run efficiently on resource-constrained hardware like a Mac M3 with 8GB RAM. The application allows users to ask questions about their data in natural language (through voice or text) and receive instant visualizations and insights without requiring complex coding knowledge.

## Core Architecture

### 1. Speech Recognition Component
- **Input Method**: Voice input through microphone or text input
- **Processing**: Speech-to-text conversion using lightweight models
- **Implementation**: Originally planned with Whisper, with fallbacks to SpeechRecognition or text-only mode

### 2. Language Model Component
- **Core Engine**: Ollama with Qwen 4B model
- **Key Function**: Converts natural language queries to executable pandas/matplotlib code
- **Optimization**: Local inference with minimal memory footprint
- **Fallback**: Simulation mode with pre-built responses when Ollama is unavailable

### 3. Data Processing Pipeline
- **Framework**: Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib for visualization
- **Sample Data**: Auto-generated datasets for immediate testing
- **Execution**: Safe evaluation of generated code in controlled environment

### 4. User Interface
- **Framework**: Streamlit for interactive web application
- **Features**: File uploads, query history, code inspection, visualization display
- **Responsiveness**: Optimized for quick feedback on limited hardware

## Implementation Process

### 1. Planning & Architecture Design
- Selected problem statement: Voice-controlled data analysis assistant
- Defined core capabilities and constraints
- Chose lightweight, open-source components compatible with Mac M3

### 2. Core Component Development
- Created modular codebase with clear separation of concerns
- Developed sample dataset generation for immediate testing
- Implemented prompt engineering for optimal code generation

### 3. Integration & Optimization
- Connected speech, LLM, and data processing pipelines
- Optimized memory usage through model quantization and efficient code
- Added graceful degradation with fallbacks when dependencies unavailable

### 4. Testing & Refinement
- Addressed dependency issues (Whisper, PyAudio, llama_cpp)
- Implemented alternative approaches for better compatibility
- Created startup scripts and helpers for easier deployment

## Key Features
